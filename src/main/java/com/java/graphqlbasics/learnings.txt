1. Query
A query is used to read or fetch data from the server.
It's analogous to a GET request in RESTful APIs. Queries are designed to be idempotent,
meaning they do not change the server's state.

2. Mutation
A mutation is used to modify data on the server.
It's analogous to POST, PUT, DELETE, etc., in RESTful APIs.
Mutations are designed to change the server's state and may have side effects.

3. 3. Subscription
A subscription is used for real-time updates.
It's analogous to WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE) in traditional
web development.
Subscriptions allow the server to push updates to the client when specific events occur.
